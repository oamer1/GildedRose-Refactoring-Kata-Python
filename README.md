# GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata-Python
Python refactoring of Gilded Rose

Based on the [multi-language repository](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata) by @emilybache.

The main idea of this problem , you are working with legacy code with no tests !
You are asked to add a feature , and handed the code requirements .  
To add a feature, you must :  
1. Understand requirements  
2. Write a good test suite   
3. Refactor code without breaking and never altering Item class otherwise a goblin devloper will devour you .  
(This is meant to impose constrain on you so you respect the interface and do not break other legacy code that depend on it)  
4. Finally add the feature !!
